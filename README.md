# INST326_Outfit_Builder
An application that uses the day’s temperature, humidity, and wind speed in order to build an appropriate outfit.
We have chosen this as our project because nowadays, Maryland weather can be very unpredictable and that can make it hard to know what to wear.
Hopefully, this application will save some time in the mornings.
The application will take the users’ city as input to find the weather. It will not pull pieces from the users’ personal wardrobe. 
Instead, it will suggest broader elements, such as sleeve length, how many layers to wear, and recommended materials (denim, cotton, wool, etc.). 
This way, users can express their personal style while still dressing appropriately for the weather.
